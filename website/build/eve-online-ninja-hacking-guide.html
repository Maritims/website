        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The only sites which can be ninja hacked in C5 wormholes are the Unsecured Frontier Server bank data sites, and the Forgotten Core Data Field relic sites. This is due to the low incoming damage on the first waves of these sites which is unique in comparison to the other data and relic sites in C5 wormholes.</p>
        <p>In order to hack these sites you only require one ship, and in this article that one ship will a Myrmidon, the Gallente Tier 1 Battlecruiser, with a very cheap fit. There's no need for expensive fits when following the approach described here.</p>

        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <p>This guide is written based on the experience of a pilot with near-perfect drone skills and Gallente Battlecruiser V. This is of doable with both Gallente Battlecruiser III and IV, but with less efficiency of course. I would not recommend attempting these sites with low to medium drone skills. My drone skills at the time of writing this guide are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Advanced Drone Avionics III</li>
            <li>Caldari Drone Specialization IV</li>
            <li>Drone Avionics V</li>
            <li>Drone Durability V</li>
            <li>Drone Interfacing V</li>
            <li>Drone Navigation V</li>
            <li>Drone Sharpshooting V</li>
            <li>Drones V</li>
            <li>Heavy Drone Operation V</li>
        </ul>

    <section id="the-fit">
        <h2>The fit</h2>
        <p>This fit can be used to comfortably run these sites in all but Wolf Rayet type wormholes. You may feel slightly uncomfortable in a Magnetar type wormhole due to the reduction drone tracking, but you will succeed regardless. If you want to do these sites in Wolf Rayet type wormholes as well you can use two Myrmidons without having to worry at all.</p>

    <section id="before-running-the-site">
        <h2>Before running the site</h2>
        <p>Warp to the site with a cloaked scout and bookmark one of the collidable objects. The Abandoned Talocan Battleship wreck will spawn roughly 8000 to 9000 meters from this point once you arrive on grid uncloaked in your Myrmidon. This will spare you the trouble of slowboating from the site's initial warp-in point and should prevent your drones from taking a major beating by having a long flight over to the rats.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="running-the-site">
        <h2>Running the site</h2>
        <p>Once you're on grid near the collidable with your Myrmidon, deploy your Mobile Tractor Unit, Mobile Depot and drones, and then kill all the rats except for the last Awakened Defender to prevent the next wave from spawning. Prioritise the frigates, then the cruisers.</p>
        <p>As the rats die off you can swap out Shield Power Relay IIs with Drone Damage Amplifier IIs to finish the remaining rats faster, but remember to pay attention to your shield regen so you don't go overboard and die.</p>
        <p>Now refit in order to move, scan and hack more effectively:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Replace three Large Shield Extender II with one 100MN Afterburner II, one Cargo Scaner II and one Relic Analyzer I.</li>
            <li>Replace all low slots with one Warp Core Stabilizer II, two Capacitor Power Relay II and three Expanded Cargohold II.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>From this point the next steps differ slightly depending on whether you're at an Unsecured Frontier Server bank or a Forgotten Core Data Field, but remember to scoop your Mobile Depot before contiuing.</p>
    </section>
    

    <section id="unsecured-frontier-server-bank">
        <h2>Unsecured Frontier Server Bank</h2>
        <p>When ninja hacking this type of data site we're going for the Abandoned Talocan Battleship wreck. This typically a couple of tens millions ISK worth of items. This requires a Relic Analyzer I to hack, while the remaining containers in the site require a Data Analyzer I to hack.</p>
        <p>Activate your 100MN Afterburner and approach the Abandoned Talocan Battleship wreck. Once you're within 2000 meters of the wreck, stop your ship and deploy your Mobile Depot, then hack and loot the Abandoned Talocan Battleship wreck.</p>
        <p>Now scan all the data containers on grid and tag the ones you consider to be worth hacking. If you find any, replace your Relic Analyzer I with a Data Analyzer I, scoop your Mobile Depot, activate your 100MN Afterburner II and approach the cans in your preferred order, for instance most to least valuable.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="forgotten-core-data-field">
        <h2>Forgotten Core Data Field</h2>
        <p>This type of relic site does not have the Abandoned Talocan Battleship Wreck. Simply scan all the relic containers with your Cargo Scanner II, tag the containers you consider to be worth your time, activate your 100MN Afterburner II, approach and hack in your preferrred order, for instance most valuable to least valuable.</p>    
    </section>

    <section id="leaving-the-site">
        <h2>Leaving the site</h2>
        <p>Now that you've hacked all the containers you wanted, you will want to leave the site.</p>
        <p>In order to leave the site, you must be resistant to one warp scrambling and verify that you have done the following:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>You have recalled your drones.</li>
            <li>You have fitted one Warp Core Stabilizer II, two Capacitor Power Relay II and no Shield Power Relay II.</li>
            <li>You have looted and scooped your Mobile Tractor Unit.</li>
            <li>You have scooped your Mobile Depot.</li>
            <li>You have deactivated your 100MN Afterburner II.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Now simply align your ship to wherever you wish to go, and once you're aligned activate your Warp Core Stabilizer II and warp to your desired destination.</p>
