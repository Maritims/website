            <p>Sometimes SAR alerts are sent with a UTM coordinate describing where to link up or where to extract the patient. I could not find a practical app to convert UTM to latitude and longitude, so I wrote this Java package. The conversion is based on the Thompson-Lee series, a variant of Gauss-Krüger.</p>
            <p>
                Features include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Converting latitude and longitude to UTM coordinate</li>
                    <li>Converting UTM coordinate to latitude and longitude</li>
                    <li>Parsing UTM coordinate with latitude band</li>
                    <li>Parsing UTM coordinate with hemisphere</li>
                </ul>

            <a href="https://github.com/Maritims/norsk-programmering-badge" target="_blank">The Norsk Programmering badge found in my footer</a>
            <p>I was inspired by <a href="https://web.badges.world" target="_blank">Web Badges World</a> to create a web badge for Norsk Programmering which people can use on their websites. This is a simple web component written in JavaScript which anyone can download and use.</p>
