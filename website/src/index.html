        <p>Welcome to my personal website, which does not attempt in any way to resemble what websites tend to look and act
            like these days. I'm trying to keep it as plain and simple as possible.</p>
        <section id="who-am-i">

            <h2>What will I find here?</h2>
            <p>Whatever I wish to publish somewhere, and I don't want to use the Meta platform. I've recently added <a
                    href="./gallery.html">the gallery</a> to replace my Instagram feed.</p>
            <p>You might find that the main menu isn't necessarily divided into generic categories, and that's perfectly
                fine. It's part of what I used to find charming about websites back in the 90s and early 2000s. What's next,
                maybe a guestbook to sign?</p>
